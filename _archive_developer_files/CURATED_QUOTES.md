### Curation Approach

This collection focuses on **timeless wisdom from historical figures** whose works are largely in the public domain or freely quotable. The selection prioritizes:

1. **Copyright Safety:** Authors who died 70+ years ago (primarily pre-1955)
2. **Verified Attribution:** Quotes cross-referenced across multiple reputable sources
3. **Thematic Diversity:** Coverage of learning, persistence, action-taking, growth, and resilience
4. **Optimal Length:** 10-50 words for 10-15 second readability
5. **Universal Appeal:** Wisdom that transcends time, culture, and context

**Key Strategy:** Focus on public domain authors (Aristotle, Franklin, Einstein's early works, Roosevelt, etc.) to ensure zero copyright concerns while maintaining inspirational quality.
